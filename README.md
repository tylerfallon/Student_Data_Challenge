# Student_Data_Challenge

The analysis and cleaning of the data resulted in several interesting discoveries. Here is some key information from the deliverables:

Deliverable 1:

The data was first imported into our analysis file using the “read_csv” function and the proper path to our .csv file was entered. 

Deliverable 2:

The data was prepared and cleaned for analysis in several ways. Duplicate information and incomplete information was removed from our data, and columns like the grade column were altered from string type data to int type.

Deliverable 3:

The overall mean math score was 64.67573326141189. 
The minimum reading score was 10.5. 

Deliverable 4:

The mean reading score for all students in grade 11 and 12 was 74.90038089192188. 

We also displayed all of the reading scores for 10th graders at Dixon High School, which can be seen in the data analysis we performed. 

The row with the overall minimum reading score was stored and displayed as well.


Deliverable 5:

The average reading score for Charter schools was 72.450603, while for Public schools it was 72.281219. These values are relatively similar. For the average math scores, Charter schools averaged a 66.761883 while Public schools scored a 62.951576. It appears as if Charter schools did a bit better than Public schools with math scores. 

We also sorted by student count at each high school, and found the school with the most students to be Montgomery High School, with 2038 students, while Chang High School had the lowest number of students, with 171 students in total. The other schools fall in between these values and can be seen in our data analysis.
